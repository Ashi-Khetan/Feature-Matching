# Feature-Matching
Feature Matching extracts defining key features from an input image and query image and find the similarities in them using the distance between their descriptors. There are three methods used for it-  a. Brute-Force Matching with ORB Descriptors             b. Brute-Force Matching with SIFT Descriptors      c. FLANN based Matcher (FLANN stands Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbours)
